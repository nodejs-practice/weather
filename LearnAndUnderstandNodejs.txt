Learn and Understand Node.js

V8 - The Javascript Engine
Procesors
We give instructions(code) to processors (tiny machine). Not all processors speak the same code.
Processors may speak IA-32, X86-64, ARM, MIPS

Machine Code (Machine Language): Programming language spoken by computer processors. Every program you run on your computer has been converted (compiled) into machine code.

Javascript > C/C++ > Assembly Language > Machine language
Javascript is a high level language. We write programs that other programs will convert to machine language.

Node is written in C++. Because, V8, the javascript engine is written in C++.

EMCAScript: The standard javascript is based on.
Javascript Engine: A program that converts Javascript code into something the computer processor can understand. And it should follow the ECMAScript standard.

NodeJS is a C++ program with V8 embedded to make it suitable to be a server technology.

Servers and Clients
What does Javascript need to manage a server.
* Better ways to organize our code into reusable pieces - using modules
* Ways to deal with files
* Ways to deal with databases
* Ability to communicate over the internet.
* Ability to accept requests and send responses.
* Way to deal with work that takes a long time.

Node Core
* The C++ Core
* The Javascript Core

Install Node
node -v => shows version

Modules, Exports and Requires
Modules: A reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code.
Javascript has modules since ES2016

CommonJS modules: Agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured

First-class functions and function expressions
Functions in javascript are first-class. That means we can pass them around like variables.

Modules
require('./module.js');

MOdule is self-contained. Functions declared inside it, will not overwrite outside.
module.exports = functionname;

Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

JSON: Javascript object notation

Module patterns
* module.exports = function() {}

* module.exports.greet = function() {}
* var greet = require('./greet.js').greet;
* Constructor and module.exports = new Greetr();
Requiring same module again will display cached results. So new object pointing to same require will point to old object.
* module.exports = Greetr => give program the ability to create object
* module.exports exposes only required functions to outside in form of an object

Exports vs Module.exports
exports is shorthand for module.exports
Just use module.exports

Node Core Modules
Check api section in node.js

Modules and ES6
ES6 has modules built-in.

export and import: put export keyword before function keyword to export in ES6.

FIFTH PART
Events and the Event Emitter
Event: Something that has happened in our app that we can respond to.
In Node we actually talk about two different kinds of events.
* System Events - comes from the C++ core, thanks to library called libuv. Eg: finished reading file, file open, received data from internet. Things that javascript doesn't have.
* Custom Events - Javascript core. Javascript library of events that deals with events that we can create ourselves in the code. Event Emitter.
Often libuv generates a javascript event.

Javascript aside - objects
obj.greet = obj["greet"]
Functions are first-class citizens in Javascript. Which means they can be used like string, numbers etc. We can have functions as an item in an array.

Node Event Emitter
Event Listener: The code that responds to an event. In Javascript's case, the listener will be a function.
There can be many listeners listening for the same event, and all of them will be invoked when that event happens.

Magic String: A string that has some special meaning in our code.

Object.create and Prototypes

babeljs.io -> compatibility for old js versions

Only for VS Code: use jsconfig.json in the folder to tell VSCode that we are using ES6

Template Literals
Is a way to concatenate strings in Javascript ES6. EAsier to work than usign + operator.

JS Call and Apply
Using call, we can send an object for use of this keyword.
obj.greet.call({name: 'John Doe'}, param1, param2);
obj.greet.apply({name: 'John Doe'}, [param1, param2]);
