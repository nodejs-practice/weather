Modules, Exports and Requires
Modules: A reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code.
Javascript has modules since ES2016

CommonJS modules: Agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured

First-class functions and function expressions
Functions in javascript are first-class. That means we can pass them around like variables.

Modules
require('./module.js');

MOdule is self-contained. Functions declared inside it, will not overwrite outside.
module.exports = functionname;

Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

JSON: Javascript object notation

Module patterns
* module.exports = function() {}

* module.exports.greet = function() {}
* var greet = require('./greet.js').greet;

* Constructor and module.exports = new Greetr();

Requiring same module again will display cached results. So new object pointing to same require will point to old object.
